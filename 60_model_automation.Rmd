**자율주행**

- Level 0: Automated system issues warnings and may momentarily intervene but has no sustained vehicle control.
- Level 1 (“hands on”): The driver and the automated system share control of the vehicle. Examples are Adaptive Cruise Control and Parking Assistance
- Level 2 (“hands off”): The automated system takes full control of the vehicle (accelerating, braking, and steering).
- Level 3 (“eyes off”): The driver can safely turn their attention away from the driving tasks, e.g. the driver can text or watch a movie.
- Level 4 (“mind off”): As level 3, but no driver attention is ever required for safety, e.g. the driver may safely go to sleep or leave the driver’s seat.
- Level 5 (“steering wheel optional”): No human intervention is required at all. An example would be a robotic taxi.

**autoML**

- Level 0: No automation. You code your own ML algorithms. From scratch. In C++.
- Level 1: Use of high-level algorithm APIs. Sklearn, Keras, Pandas, H2O, XGBoost, etc.
- Level 2: Automatic hyperparameter tuning and ensembling. Basic model selection.
- Level 3: Automatic (technical) feature engineering and feature selection, technical data augmentation, GUI.
- Level 4: Automatic domain and problem specific feature engineering, data augmentation, and data integration.
- Level 5: Full ML Automation. Ability to come up with super-human strategies for solving hard ML problems without any input or guidance. Fully conversational interaction with the human user.
